TASK 6- Develop a visualization that compares the number of replies, retweets, and likes for tweets that have received media engagements greater than the median value. Include a filter for tweets posted in between June and August of 2020 and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and tweet date should be odd number and media views should be even number as well as tweet character count should be above 20 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'S'.

TASK 7- Create a line chart showing the trend of the average engagement rate over each month of the year. Separate the lines for tweets with media content and those without and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet engagement should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 20 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'C'.
